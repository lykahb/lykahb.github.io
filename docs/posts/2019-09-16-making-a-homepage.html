        <p>After many iterations of polishing this website and taking time for the other projects, it is finally ready!</p>
<p>I want to thank Sarah Dresner, who at Smashing Conf showed that it is possible to build a good-looking
homepage in less than an hour, even with templates and server-side rendering.
I also want to thank Sandy Maguire for sharing ideas and help with beating procrastination.</p>
