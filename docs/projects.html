<p>A browser extension that hides sticky elements from the page. In case you are curious about the name, I was looking for a mascot associated with cleanliness. This rubber ducky makes the page clean from headers, footers and other mess.</p>
<h3 id="groundhog"><a href="https://github.com/lykahb/groundhog">Groundhog</a></h3>
<p>Object relational mapping library for Haskell. It is used in production by several companies and was mentioned in the first edition of O’Reilly book <i>Developing Web Applications with Haskell and Yesod</i>.</p>
<p>This was a part of my Master’s thesis on modelling algebraic data types in a relational database. Both for the name and certain architectural decisions were inspired by the Java framework Hibernate.</p>
<h3 id="neotools"><a href="https://github.com/lykahb/neotools">Neotools</a></h3>
<p>Command-line utility for AlphaSmart NEO. This is a retro device which looks like a keyboard with a screen that displays several lines of text. Many consider it one of the best tools for distraction-free writing. Neotools can manage files, install applets, and tweak applet settings. Neotools is written with Python and uses raw USB protocol for communication. It aims to be a simple, low-level and portable tool, which complements the platform-dependent desktop tools NEO Manager and AlphaSync.</p>
