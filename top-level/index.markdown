I'm Borys Lykah. I am a software engineer living in Calgary with my family.

I build banking stack at Mercury with Haskell.

In the university I developed interest in a more rigorous and mathematical approach to software, which led me to functional programming and advanced type systems. My experience from the functional world helps me create more composable and robust systems for web.

In my spare time I hike, read books and do home improvement. I also play go and board games. Here are some open-source <a href="/projects">projects</a> I made.
