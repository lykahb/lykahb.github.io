I am a software engineer living in Ottawa with my wife. Apart from a personal homepage, this is also my web development playground.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI build data analysis tools at SurveyMonkey.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI came to Canada from Ukraine, which prepared me for the harsh Ontario winters. I hold a Master's Degree with Honors in Computer Engineering from the Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute, the second-oldest technical university in the collapsed empire. During the studies I developed interest in a more mathematical approach to programming, which led me to functional programming and advanced type systems. My experience from the functional world helps me create more composable and robust systems for web.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn my spare time I hike, read books and do home improvement. I also play go and board games. I created and maintain several open-source <a href=\"/projects\">projects</a>.\n</p>\n\n<p>Contact me at lykahb [at] gmail [dot] com\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlso see my <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://github.com/lykahb\">Github</a> and \n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lykahb/\">LinkedIn</a>\n</p>"
